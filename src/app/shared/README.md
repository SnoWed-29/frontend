# Shared Module

This folder contains reusable UI components, directives, and pipes that can be used across different features.

## Structure

- **components/** - Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, cards, etc.)
- **directives/** - Custom directives
- **pipes/** - Custom pipes for data transformation

## Guidelines

- Components should be generic and reusable
- Avoid feature-specific logic
- Export all components/directives/pipes that need to be used in features
- Components should be standalone or part of a shared module
